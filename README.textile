h1. YUI Git

This is an attempt at making a: @git yui@ command line tool for use when contributing to YUI.


h2. Installation

You must have python installed on your machine before this will work.
To install, clone the project. Then place the @git-yui@ file in your path somewhere.

That should do it. Eventually, I'll build a Makefile for it :)

h3. TODO (in order of importance)

* Sync Sources (working)
* Fetch/Merge another users repo (working)
* Build a Component from Source (working[1])
* Build all Component Sources (working[1])
* Generate API Docs (working[2])
* Run JSLint on a file (working)
* List all project forks (working)
* Submit a Pull Request (working)
* Create Build Files (working)
* Bash Completion Support[5]
* Windows Support[4]
* Add a Ticket[3]
* Commit/Comment on a ticket[3] (working on beta server)
* View summary of a ticket[3] (working on beta server)

fn1. Partially working, waiting on developers to standardize build files

fn2. Partially working, all docs currently throws an error (one of the files in src is bad.).

fn3. Pending the release of the new YUI Bug Tracker with API support.

fn4. If anyone wants to help out with this part, please do. I don't like building dev tools on Windows.

fn5. Partial Bash completion working for the top most commands. Info added "here":http://wiki.github.com/davglass/yui-git/bash-completion
