h1. YUI Git

This is an attempt at making a: @git yui@ command line tool for use when contributing to YUI.


h2. Installation

You must have python installed on your machine before this will work.
To install, clone the project. Then place the @git-yui@ file in your path somewhere.

That should do it. Eventually, I'll make a Makefile for it :)

h2. TODO (in order of importance)

* Sync Sources (working)
* Fetch/Merge another users repo (working)
* Build a Component (partially working)
* Build all Component Sources
* Submit a Pull Request
* Create Build Files
